            <h2 class="text-center">Overview</h2>
            <p>In this project, we created a simple rasterizer to parse SVG files and use basic shapes like triangles to render an image in a GUI. We used antialiasing techniques including supersampling and implemented transform functions such as rotations, scaling, and translations and mipmap pixel sampling and level sampling for texture mapping.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

            <h3 class="text-center">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

            <p>We first found the bounding box around the triangle by finding the minimum and maximum values of the x and y vertices given. These min and max values are used to iterate over all the points within the box. The line test we used in lecture is then used to check whether the current (x, y) pair is inside the triangle given the three line equations. If the point passes the line test for all three lines, it is inside the triangle. The (x, y) pair can either result in a value >= 0 or <= 0 for all three lines. Both need to be checked in case the points are given in clockwise or counterclockwise order. The (x, y) point is used to calculate the right index in the sample buffer and this index is assigned to the color argument. It is “no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle” because that is exactly what it does, finding the minimum and maximum of the x and y values and iterating over these values.</p>

        <div id="antialiasing">
            <h3 class="text-center">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

            <p>For this task, we followed a similar procedure to Task 1, but incorporated a technique for antialiasing called supersampling. This works by increasing the sample rate, by taking more samples within the standard pixel region, and then downsampling by taking the average of the samples to “smooth” out the values and soften the jaggies. The first difference between Task 1 is that once we find the min and max values of the bounding box, we scale them by sqrt(sample_rate). We then scale all the vertex coordinates by the same factor so that the line tests will be testing that the points lie in the triangle at higher resolution. Other than that, the tests are the same. The next change includes resizing the sample buffer and when we calculate the index to fill in within the sample_buffer array. The old manner of calculating the index was (y * width + x) and now we change it to (y * width * sqrt(sample_rate) + x) to account for the change in size of the sample_buffer. The rest of rasterize_triangle() is the same. Next, in resolve_to_framebuffer() we iterate through the whole screen from 0 to width and 0 to height. For each point, we need to sample sample_rate points so we use two nested for loops that sample sample_rate evenly-spaced points. Then, we extract from the sample_buffer at the following index: sample_rate * (y * width) + a + sqrt(sample_rate) * x + z where z and a are iterating from 0 to sqrt(sample_rate) each. Indexing into the sample_buffer gives us a Color object from which we can extract the RGB values. The rgb_framebuffer_target array defines the image that will appear in our GUI so we take the RGB values from the sample_buffer at all the sample points, add them up, and average them such that we have only one set of RGB values per pixel. This process is useful because the jaggy edges of pixelated objects are less visible and appear smoother when we use supersampling and increase the sample rate (as seen below).</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

            <p>Pixel sampling is the process of mapping pixels from one image to another. We implemented pixel sampling to perform texture mapping by taking the color values of the pixels in the texture space at (u,v) and applying it to the corresponding coordinate (x,y) in the screen space. In the example below, we used different sampling methods, including nearest-neighbor sampling and bilinear sampling. For nearest-neighbor sampling, the closest pixel to the (u,v) coordinate was taken and applied to (x,y). For bilinear sampling, we took four nearest pixels and weighted their color values based on their distance to (u,v), then used this color to assign to (x,y).</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

            <p>Mipmap level sampling is another technique to optimize texture mapping. Mipmaps are pre-calculated, optimized sequences of images, each of which is a progressively lower resolution representation of the previous. By using mipmaps, we can minimize aliasing and improve rendering speed. We implemented level sampling using nearest level sampling and trilinear level sampling. Nearest level sampling involves selecting the mipmap level that most closely matches the size of the screen space pixel. Trilinear level sampling involves interpolating between two mipmap levels to get smoother transitions.</p>
